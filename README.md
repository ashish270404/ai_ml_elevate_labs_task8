This task applies unsupervised learning using the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment mall customers based on their gender, age, annual income, and spending score. The dataset is loaded and preprocessed using Pandas and Scikit-learn, with gender encoded and features standardized. To aid visualization, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the data to two dimensions. The Elbow Method is employed to determine the optimal number of clusters (K), after which the K-Means model is trained and cluster labels are assigned. The resulting customer segments are visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn, with color-coded clusters in a 2D PCA space. Finally, the clustering performance is evaluated using the Silhouette Score, helping to assess the quality of separation between customer groups.
